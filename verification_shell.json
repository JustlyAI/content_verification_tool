The transition from predictable, instruction-based tools to autonomous, goal-oriented AI agents presents one of the most profound shifts in software engineering in decades. While these agents unlock incredible capabilities, their inherent non-determinism makes them unpredictable and shatters our traditional models of quality assurance.\nThis whitepaper serves as a practical guide to this new reality, founded on a simple but radical principle:\nAgent quality is an architectural pillar, not a final testing phase.\nThis guide is built on three core messages:",
